========== Memory management ==========

To some Dart-side objects is associated a C++-side peer object.
For example, a Frame is associated with a wxFrame, and a Window is associated with a wxWindow.
Either of these objects may be be marked by deletion by their first,
so the resource management can not be done in any which way.

There are three scenarios to consider:

1. C++-side, the wx window object is destroyed, either because it is a top-level window which is closed or destroyed, or because the widget is a child of another widget which is now destroyed, which causes all of its children to be destroyed as well.
   Because we can't stop deletion because of parent destruction,
   Dart objects will lose their C++ counterparts in this case.
2. Dart-side, the window object is deleted because the garbage collector has determined it to be unreachable
   2a. The wx window object has not been added to a container. It is to be deleted, because nothing refers to it any longer.
   2b. The wx window object has been added to a container. It is not to be deleted, because the container has ownership of it.

The resource life-cycle management on the two sides is done as follows:

      Dart                            C++
    +----------+                    +----------+
    |          |  peer  +----+      |          |
    | Dart obj.|------->|Peer|--w-->| C++ obj. |
    |          |<--(w)--|    |      |          |
    +----------+        +----+      +----------+

- The Dart-side object has a peer (in Native Extension terminology).
- The peer has a wxWeakRef to the C++-side object.
- When the C++-side object is created, a WeakPersistentHandle is made for the
  Dart-side object, with a deletion action which releases the C++-side object in case it is not already owned by a container.
- The peer tracks whether the window is owned by a container or by the Dart object via the peer.


== Event binding
Event handling involves callback to Dart code (methods or closures).
This is handled with a persistent handle to the Dart object, like this:

      Dart              wxObject      C++
    +----------+          ^             +----------+
    |          |        +----+ callback |          |
    | Dart obj.|<-(ph)--|Obj.|<---------| C++ obj. |
    |          |        |    |          |          |
    +----------+        +----+          +----------+
